# BERT-powered-Chatbot

## 📋 Project Overview:
This project is a BERT-powered chatbot built with Streamlit, designed to provide intelligent, context-aware responses to user queries across multiple categories, including General, Artificial Intelligence, Programming, and Cloud Computing. It features a dynamic user interface that allows for customization of text color, font size, and background imagery, ensuring a visually engaging and personalized experience. Leveraging BERT embeddings and cosine similarity, the chatbot accurately matches user queries to predefined questions for precise answers. This project showcases how advanced AI models and user-centric design can be combined to create an intuitive and interactive conversational platform.

## 🚀 Features:
1. **Category-based Responses**:
  Users can select a category (General, Artificial Intelligence, Programming, or Cloud Computing) and ask questions related to that category. The chatbot will provide relevant responses based on predefined 
  question-answer pairs.
2. **BERT-powered NLP**:
  The chatbot uses BERT, a state-of-the-art model for natural language understanding, to generate embeddings for user input and match them with predefined questions. This ensures accurate and context-aware 
  responses.
3. **Cosine Similarity Matching**:
  The chatbot uses cosine similarity to compare the user’s query with predefined questions in the selected category, providing the most relevant response based on semantic similarity.
4. **Predefined Question-Answer Database**:
  The chatbot is equipped with a set of predefined questions and responses for different categories, allowing users to instantly interact and receive relevant information.
5. **Streamlit-based Interface**:
  The application is built using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating interactive web applications. This makes it easy to deploy and share the chatbot interface.

##  🤖 Technologies Used:
- Python: The primary programming language for building the chatbot.
- Streamlit: A framework used to create the web-based interface of the chatbot.
- Hugging Face Transformers (BERT): Used for natural language processing and understanding user queries.
- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): A pre-trained language model for generating embeddings and understanding the context of queries.
- PyTorch: A deep learning framework used for loading and processing the BERT model.
- scikit-learn: Used for calculating cosine similarity between embeddings.
- HTML & CSS (via Streamlit): Custom styles for user interface design.
- Base64 Encoding: For setting background images in the app.

##  📌 Use Cases:
1. **Customer Support**:
  Can be adapted for businesses to assist with frequently asked questions and guide users through basic troubleshooting or product information.
2. **Personal Assistant**:
  Can be customized to serve as a personal knowledge assistant for general or domain-specific inquiries.
3.**Education and Learning Support**:
  Provides answers to questions related to specific domains like Artificial Intelligence, Programming, and Cloud Computing, making it a useful learning companion for students and professionals.
